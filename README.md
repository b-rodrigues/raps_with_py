# Building reproducible analytical pipelines with Python

This is the repository containing the source code to my free
ebook called "Building reproducible analytical pipelines with Python".
The book is still being written, and I expect to finish it by
the end of 2024.

You can find the R edition here
[https://raps-with-r.dev](https://raps-with-r.dev). The R edition is longer: it
contains chapters on packaging and functional programming which the Python
version does not have, and two chapters on Git, which have been condensed into
one in this version.

If you spot a typo, feel free to open an issue or pull request.
